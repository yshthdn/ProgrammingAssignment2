## Programming Assignment 2 - R Programming
## Data Science Specialization Track
##
## These two functions are part of completing the second
## programming assignment for the R Programming course 
## offered on Coursera through the Johns Hopkins
## School for Public Health
##
## The two functions shown here help in caching the
## inverse of a matrix.  Matrix inversion is usually
## very computationally intensive - especially for large
## size matrices.  Sometimes in code (and especially in loops),
## the inverse of a matrix need only be computed once.  
## To avoid recomputing the inverse and generating the
## same result repeatedly, we can simply compute the
## result once.  If you try to recompute the inverse again,
## we have already computed this already and so we should
## just return this pre-computed result.
##

## makeCacheMatrix:
## To facilitate this caching, you first create a special
## matrix that will help us with this by using the
## makeCacheMatrix function.  The input into this function
## is simply a variable of type matrix.
##
## Usage example:
## x <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2)
## m <- makeCacheMatrix(x)

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        # Following the same format as the assignment example
        # Creating a makeCacheMatrix object will consist of
        # four functions encapsulated in a list
        # 1. set the matrix
        # 2. get the matrix
        # 3. set the inverse of the matrix
        # 4. get the inverse of the matrix
        
        # Initially set to NULL
        # Changes when the user sets the value
        inv <- NULL
        
        # set function
        # Sets the matrix itself but not the inverse
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        
        # get function
        # Gets the matrix itself but not the inverse
        get <- function() x
        
        # Manually set the inverse
        setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        
        # Get the inverse
        getinverse <- function() inv
        
        # Encapsulate into a list
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)	
}

## cacheSolve:
## Once you create this matrix, you use the cacheSolve
## function to compute the inverse and cache the result
##
## If you try using cacheSolve again on the same special
## matrix, then the pre-computed result is obtained, thus
## avoiding any recomputation.  An informative message
## will be shown in the command prompt when the pre-computed
## result is returned instead.
##
## Usage example:
## x <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2)
## m <- makeCacheMatrix(x)
## s <- cacheSolve(m)
## print(s)
## s should return:
##     [,1] [,2]
##[1,]   -2  1.5
##[2,]    1 -0.5
##
## s2 <- cacheSolve(m)
## This should display a "Getting cached matrix" message
## print(s2)
## s2 should return
##     [,1] [,2]
##[1,]   -2  1.5
##[2,]    1 -0.5

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        # Following the same format as the assignment example
        
        # Get the current state of the inverse and see if it
        # has been computed yet
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        
        # If it has...
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                # Simply return the computed inverse		
                message("Getting cached matrix")
                return(inv)
        }
        
        # If it hasn't...
        # Get the matrix itself
        data <- x$get()
        
        # Find the inverse
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        
        # Cache this result in the object
        x$setinverse(inv)
        
        # Return this new result
        inv
